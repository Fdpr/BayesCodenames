# Codenames RSA

This code is only a subset of the code used in my master's thesis, as some of it cannot be published or contains outdated code. This means that most of the notebooks will probably fail running some cells. However, the notebooks aren't really polished anyway. They just document the programming journey undertaken during this thesis.

If you don't know what RSA or Codenames are, you should probably not be here.

## Running the models

Install the CodenamesRSA environment from the YAML-file.

Then, to let two models run against each other, follow the example code in example.ipynb. All the code is presented without comment, good luck!

An interactive mode to play together with an agent is not supported yet. Check back later!
